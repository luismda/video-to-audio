This project is a simple tool to convert multiple videos within a directory into audios, using Node.js and FFMPEG CLI.

> In addition to Node.js, you also need to have an [FFMPEG CLI](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on your computer.

So run these commands below:

```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/luismda/video-to-audio.git

# Install the dependencies
pnpm i

# Start tool ðŸš€
pnpm start

When running the tool, you will need to enter the directory containing the videos to be converted.
